# Text-Classification-with-Fine-Tuned-Language-Models
This project involves creating a custom text classification dataset and fine-tuning a pre-trained language model for classification.

## Key Components:
### Dataset Creation:
Collected at least 2000 words with three or more categories, each containing 100+ examples (e.g., poems or book paragraphs).
### Data Splitting:
Training set: At least 240 examples
Test set: At least 60 examples
### Model Fine-Tuning:
Used a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT from Hugging Face Transformers).
Fine-tuned the model on the custom dataset.
### Evaluation & Optimization:
Reported test accuracy.
Discussed strategies to improve accuracy (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, dataset balancing).
This project explores text classification, transfer learning, and NLP fine-tuning techniques.
